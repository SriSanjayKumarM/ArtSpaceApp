# Art Space App - Marvel Edition

**Art Space App** is an Android application built using **Jetpack Compose** that showcases Marvel characters instead of traditional artwork. 
This project is part of a **Google Codelab** exercise, where the goal was to create a personalized app using the knowledge gained from the 
**Android Basics with Compose** course by Google.

In the Codelab, the model app was designed to display various pieces of artwork, which is why I named it **Art Space App**. 
However, I decided to give it a unique twist by featuring images of Marvel characters instead, as I am a fan of Marvel. 
This isn't the first time I've created a Marvel-themed app either; I previously built a similar app called **Marvel App**, which was implemented using XML-based layouts. 
You can find the **Marvel App** in my GitHub repository.

With **Art Space App**, I'm now experimenting with **Jetpack Compose** to explore the modern UI toolkit and its declarative approach to building UIs. 
This app represents my journey in learning and applying **Jetpack Compose** to recreate concepts Iâ€™ve previously built using XML.

## Features

- Displays high-quality images of Marvel characters in a clean and stylish layout
- Interactive "Prev" and "Next" buttons allow easy navigation between different characters
- Stylish background gradients and modern UI design inspired by **Material Design 3**
- Created using **Jetpack Compose** for a more declarative and efficient UI experience

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI toolkit for native Android development
- **Material Design 3**: For consistent and modern visual design
- **Git**: Version control system to manage the codebase
